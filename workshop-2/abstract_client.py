class AbstractProductManager(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for managing products.

    This class defines the core operations for managing products such as
    adding, removing, and editing products. It serves as the base class for
    Client and Manager, ensuring that both classes provide concrete implementations
    of these methods.

    Methods:
        add_product: Abstract method for adding a product.
                     To be implemented by subclasses.
        remove_product: Abstract method for removing a product.
                        To be implemented by subclasses.
        edit_product: Abstract method for editing a product's details.
                      To be implemented by subclasses.

    Usage:
        This class cannot be instantiated directly. It should be subclassed by
        specific product manager classes (e.g., Client, Manager) that provide
        concrete implementations of the abstract methods.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def add_product(self, product_id: str, name: str, category: str, price: float):
        """
        Adds a new product to the product repository.

        This method should be implemented in subclasses to handle the logic for
        adding a product. It takes in the product's ID, name, category, and price.

        Args:
            product_id (str): The unique identifier for the product.
            name (str): The name of the product.
            category (str): The category to which the product belongs.
            price (float): The price of the product.

        Returns:
            None

        Removes a product from the product repository.

        This method should be implemented in subclasses to handle the logic for
        removing a product by its ID.

        Args:
            product_id (str): The unique identifier of the product to be removed.

        This method should be implemented in subclasses to handle the logic for
        updating the name, category, and price of a product based on its ID.

        Args:
            product_id (str): The unique identifier of the product to be edited.
            name (str): The updated name of the product.
