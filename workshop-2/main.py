    """Main function to handle user interaction for a product shopping application.

    This method is the entry point for the shopping cart application. It handles
    product listing, product addition to the cart, viewing the cart, and the checkout
    process through a menu-based system. The function interacts with a product
    repository, a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

    The menu options include:
    1. Listing all products.
    2. Listing products by category.
    3. Adding a product to the shopping cart.
    4. Viewing the items in the cart.
    5. Proceeding to checkout.
    6. Adding a new product.
    7. Removing a product.
    8. Editing a product.
    9. Quitting the application.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None: The function runs the menu loop until the user chooses to exit.

    Raises:
        None
